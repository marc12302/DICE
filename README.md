# ⚠️ WARNING!
<ul>
I don't tolerate gambling because it can lead to big money losses, this is just a showcase in which I show curious people what a simple algorithm for CRASH would look like.
<be><br>
Let's not forget that the casinos only bring losses and that all the games favor the casinos!
</ul>


## DICE
This showcase presents a DICE gambling game (with source code) made with an algorithm looking at your profit, and it will calculate your chances for example if you are *+profit* the chances of "casino" will increase, and if you are *-proift* your chances to your next round will increase.
<br>This program is written in C++.
### Compatibility:
<ul>
<li>MacOS</li>
<li>Linux (I didn't test it)</li>
</ul>
